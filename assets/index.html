  <h1>Dedicated to soaking in as much info in G School as possible</h1>
    <p>About <strong>Alley</strong></p>
    <p>Hi Guys!  My name is Alley Rubadeau and I am <strong>very</strong> excited/nervous
      to start G School!!!  I can't wait to crush some code and soak
      in everything I possibly can to set me up for success in my
      future software endeavors.  My husband Tristan is currently in G7 and I have a 2
      year old daughter named Summer Skye.</p>
